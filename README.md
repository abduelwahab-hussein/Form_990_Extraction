# Form_990_Extraction
Code to identify particular NPO 990s, extract 990 XML data into a workable dataset, and analyze 990 data.


The IRS used to store Form 990 files in AWS. There are github repositories that allow you to work with Form 990 data under AWS (See https://github.com/CharityNavigator/irs990 for instance). However, since the IRS does not use AWS anymore, and the IRS stores the data differently now, I created hte github repo to make it easy to work with Form 990 data.
