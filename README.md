# Form_990_Extraction

Hello!

This code does three things: 
- Identifies particular Nonprofit Organization (NPO) 990s you want to analyze
- Creates datasets of 990 information from 990 XML data for the NPOs you care about
- Cleans 990 data.

The code is available for anyone but is particularly useful for: 
- **NPOs**
- **Curious citizens**
- **Academic researchers**
- **Professionals who work with NPOs regularly**


The code is broken down into various elements and explained at length, but if you have questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me!: abduelwahabhussein@gmail.com

Note: The IRS used to store Form 990 files in AWS. There are github repositories that allow you to work with Form 990 data under AWS (See https://github.com/CharityNavigator/irs990 for instance). HOWEVER, since the IRS does not use AWS anymore, and the IRS stores the data differently now, I created hte github repo to make it easy to work with Form 990 data.
